  description: |-
    Symbl's contextual conversation intelligence platform provides scalable, secure speech recognition and contextual analytics to build differentiated experiences from voice, video or text data in realtime. Generate action items, questions, appointments, topic hierarchy, topics, sentiments, action phrases and your custom entities and so much more without any upfront training data. We give you the comprehensive suite of APIs, machine learning infrastructure and customizable experiences to analyze and act on the human conversation data at scale.

    # Authentication

    Make sure to get your app id and app secret from https://platform.symbl.ai. Use them to generate your auth token which is required to make any API call.

    # Async APIs
    The Async API provides a REST interface to allow you to run a job asynchronously in order to process insights out of **audio and video files and textual conversations** (Transcripts, Chats, Emails etc.).

    # Telephony API

    Use the `Start Connection` endpoint to start a connection with Symbl either over a **phone call or conference over PSTN or a SIP** using a Dial-in Phone Number or SIP URI with support for DTMF.

    Use the `Stop Connection` endpoint to end the call and close the connection. This will send you an email with all the generated insights from your conversation.


    # Streaming API

    Streaming API is a WebSocket based real-time API by Symbl that provides the direct, fastest and most accurate of all other interfaces to push the audio stream in real-time, and get the results back as soon as they're available.

    <h2>Postman does not support the WebSocket protocol for collections yet, which is why Streaming API is not included in this collection. <a href="https://docs.symbl.ai/docs/streamingapi/overview/introduction">Learn more</a> about Streaming API.</h2>

        # Submit Audio File
        The Async Audio API allows you to process an audio file.

        It can be utilized for any use case where you have access to recorded audio and want to extract insights and other conversational attributes supported by Symbl's Conversation API.

        Use this API to upload your file and generate a `conversationId`. If you want to append additional audio information to the same `conversationId`

        Learn More about <a href="https://docs.symbl.ai/docs/async-api/overview/audio/post-audio">Async Audio API</a>.

        # Append Audio File URL:

        The Async Audio URL API allows you to append an additional audio URL to the previous conversation, append the transcription, and get conversational insights for an updated conversation.

        It can be useful in any use case where you have access to multiple recorded audio stored publicly as URL of any type of conversation, and you want to extract the insightful items supported by the Conversation API.

        >If there are multiple requests are submitted for the same conversationId, all the requests will be processed synchronously in order to maintain the order of the requests for the conversation.

        Learn More about <a href="https://docs.symbl.ai/docs/async-api/overview/audio/put-audio-url">Async Audio API</a>.

        ## Path Params

        Parameter | value
        --------- | ----------
        ```conversationId``` | conversationId which is provided by the first request submitted using POST async audio API.

        ## Request Body

        Parameters | Required | Description
        ---------- | ------- | -------
        ```url``` | Yes |  A valid URL string. The URL must be a publicly accessible URL.
        ```customVocabulary``` | No | Contains a list of words and phrases that provide hints to the speech recognition task.
        ```confidenceThreshold``` | No | Minimum required confidence for the insight to be recognized.  Value range from 0.0 to 1.0. The default value is 0.5.
        ```detectPhrases```| No | It shows Actionable Phrases in each sentence of conversation. These sentences can be found using the Conversation's  Messages API. It's a boolean value where the default value is `false`.
        ```name``` | No | Your meeting name. Default name set to `conversationId`.
        ```webhookUrl``` | No | Webhook URL on which job updates to be sent. This should be post API.
        ``` entities``` | No |   Input custom entities which can be detected in your conversation using Entities' API. For example, check the sample code on right.
         ```languageCode```| No |  We accept different languages. Please [check language Code](https://docs.symbl.ai/docs/async-api/overview/async-api-supported-languages) as per your requirement.
        ```enableSeparateRecognitionPerChannel``` | No | Enables Speaker Separated Channel audio processing. Accepts `true` or `false`.
        ```channelMetadata``` | No | This object parameter contains two variables `speaker` and `channel` to specify which speaker corresponds to which channel. This object **only** works when `enableSeparateRecognitionPerChannel` is set to `true`.


        ### channelMetadata Object
        ```json
        {
          "channelMetadata": [
            {
              "channel": 1,
              "speaker": {
                "name": "Robert Bartheon",
                "email": "robertbartheon@gmail.com"
              }
            },
            {
              "channel": 2,
              "speaker": {
                "name": "Arya Stark",
                "email": "aryastark@gmail.com"
              }
            }
          ]
        }
        ```

        `channelMetadata` object has the following members:

        Field | Description
        ------- | -------
        ```channel``` | This denotes the channel number in the audio file. Each channel will contain independent speaker's voice data.
        ```speaker``` | This is the wrapper object which defines the speaker for this channel.

        `speaker`  has the following members:

        Field | Description
        ------- | -------
        ```name``` |  Name of the speaker.
        ```email``` | Email address of the speaker.

        >Billing for a speaker separated channel audio file happens according to the number of channels present in the audio files. The duration for billing will be calculated according to the below formula:

        >`totalDuration = duration_of_the_audio_file * total_number_of_channels`

        >So if you send a 120-second file with 3 speaker separated channels, the total duration for billing would be 360 seconds or 6 minutes.


        ## Webhook Payload

        `webhookUrl` will be used to send the status of the job created for uploaded audio. Every time the status of the job changes it will be notified on the `webhookUrl`.

        Field | Description
        ------ | ---------
        ```jobId``` | ID to be used with Job API
        ```status``` | Current status of the job. (Valid statuses - [ `scheduled`, `in_progress`, `completed`, `failed` ])

        ## Response Object

        Field  | Description
        ---------- | -------
        ```conversationId``` | ID to be used with  Conversation API.
        ```jobId``` | ID to be used with Jobs API.
