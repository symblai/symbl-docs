### Symbl JS Elements
Symbl JS elements helps developers embed customizable JS elements for transcription, insights and action items for both real-time and post conversation experience.

* Live captioning
* Topics
* Action Items
* Suggestive Actions

### Prebuilt Summary UI
Symbl provides a few prebuilt summary UI that can be used to generate a user experience of the understanding of the conversation after it has been processed. The pre-built summary UI is available as a URL that can be shared via email to all (or selected) participants or used to embed as a link as part of the conversation history within the application.

The prebuilt summary UI includes the following capabilities:

* Title and details of the conversation including date, number of participants, etc.
* Names of all the participants
* Topics covered in the conversation in the order of importance
* Full, searchable transcript of the conversation. Transcripts can be edited, copied and shared.
* Any Insights, action items or questions from the transcript. Insights can also be edited, shared or dismissed, date/assignee for action item to be modified.
* The prebuilt summary UI can also be customizable, as per the use case or product requirement.
